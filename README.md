Sand Simulation in Java - README

This project simulates granular dynamics, modeling interactions between different types of particles: sand, water, and metal. Using Java, the program simulates particle movement and behaviors based on simple physics (gravity and basic fluid dynamics).

Features:
Real-time simulation of sand and water movement.
User interaction: click to place particles (sand, water, or metal) on a 2D grid.
Simulates sand falling and water flowing based on gravity.
Allows for particle interaction, e.g., sand swapping with water.
Technologies Used:
Java for programming.
2D grid-based simulation for real-time rendering and particle interaction.
How to Run:
Clone or download the project files.
Run SandLab.java to start the simulation.
Use mouse clicks to interact with the simulation (place different particles in the grid).
Controls:
Left-click to add particles (sand, water, or metal) at the clicked location.
Enjoy experimenting with particle dynamics!
